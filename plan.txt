Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this project. It's a classic problem in 
concurrent programming known as the Dining Philosophers problem. Here's 
a high-level plan for how you might implement it:

Define a struct for a philosopher. This should include the philosopher's number, 
pointers to the mutexes for the forks on their left and right, and any other 
 information you need to keep track of (like the time they last ate).

Write a function for the behavior of a philosopher. This function should 
implement the cycle of a philosopher's behavior: thinking, then picking up forks, 
eating, putting down forks, and sleeping. Use usleep for the sleeping and eating periods.

In the main function, parse the command-line arguments and initialize an array 
of philosopher structs and an array of mutexes for the forks. Then create a 
thread for each philosopher, passing the corresponding philosopher struct as an argument.

In the philosopher function, use pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock 
to pick up and put down forks. Make sure to always acquire the mutexes in the 
same order to avoid deadlocks.

Also in the philosopher function, check if the philosopher has been eating for 
longer than time_to_die. If they have, print a message and terminate the program.

If the optional number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat argument is provided,
 keep track of how many times each philosopher has eaten and terminate the 
 program once each philosopher has eaten the required number of times.

Remember to handle errors appropriately, especially for functions like 
pthread_create and pthread_mutex_lock that can fail. Also, make sure to 
free any memory you allocate and destroy any mutexes you create.

This is a complex problem that requires careful synchronization to avoid 
issues like deadlocks and race conditions. Take it one step at a time, and 
don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Good luck!
